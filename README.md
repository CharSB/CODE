# Investigating the reliability of clustering Algorithms
Research Question: How does the K-means algorithm compare to the DBSCAN algorithm in terms of stable clustering?

For my IB Diploma I chose to conduct my Extended Essay in Computer Science.

**The following is the introduction to my essay:**

This essay intends to investigate the reliability of clustering algorithms, a type of unsupervised machine learning. I will research the K-means and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms in terms of stable clustering, as this attribute greatly contributes to how reliable an algorithm is. 
	Clustering algorithms are a type of unsupervised machine learning, where algorithms try to categorise, cluster, an unlabeled set of data to make intelligent groups. There are also several other criteria that one might look for when investigating the most appropriate clustering algorithm for different contexts.
	Clustering algorithms have been greatly researched in the past 30 years with the rise of machine learning, with the field only growing in popularity and applications by the day. The use of unsupervised algorithms is frequently used in market research and business, in order to classify customers. Clustering algorithms also have applications in spatial detection, distinguishing between different forms, objects, in order to better analyse geometric data. These clustering algorithms have many applications, as finding patterns within data is relevant in almost every industry.
	The two algorithms were implemented in python, with a variety of differently arranged data sets used. The algorithms were executed several times in order to see how random changes in initialisations would lead to different results. The results were then compared to determine the reliability of each algorithm.
